        <h1>About Autism Spectrum</h1>
        
        <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves challenges with social interaction, communication, repetitive behaviors, and often, sensory sensitivities. It is called a "spectrum" disorder because it affects individuals differently and to varying degrees. Some individuals with ASD may require significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and may even have exceptional abilities.</p>
        
        <h2>Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty with social interactions and relationships</li>
            <li>Challenges with communication, including both verbal and non-verbal communication</li>
            <li>Repetitive behaviors or rituals</li>
            <li>Sensory sensitivities</li>
            <li>Strong focus on specific interests</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder involves comprehensive evaluation by healthcare professionals, including developmental pediatricians, psychologists, and speech therapists. Diagnosis typically involves observation of behavior, interviews with caregivers, and standardized assessments.</p>
        
        <h2>Treatment and Support</h2>
        <p>While there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, early intervention services, such as behavioral therapy and speech therapy, can significantly improve outcomes. Additionally, support services and accommodations can help individuals with ASD thrive in various environments, including school and employment settings.</p>
        
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>There are many resources available for individuals with autism spectrum disorder and their families, including support groups, advocacy organizations, and educational materials. It's essential to connect with trusted sources for accurate information and support.</p>
